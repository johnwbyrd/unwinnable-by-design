Welcome, adventurer.  You are about to embark on a journey, just as exciting as The Beastmaster or Conan The Destroyer, but one that you experience on your personal microcomputer.  In this incredible new medium, we use your personal microcomputer, as a window into a dynamic new form of storytelling.  Unlike a traditional book, where you turn pages and may get paper cuts, your choices drive the story forward, by typing on your microcomputer, and seeing the results pop up as words on your color TV.  We like to call this incredible new medium, "interactive fiction," in that it is both fictional, which means made up, and it is interactive, which means active in an inter way.

Interactive fiction is like the books and stories that you have read before, but now with the ability to dynamically choose story choices based on choosing your own choices.  This is a truly new form of entertainment, which literally no human being could possibly imagine, until this very moment.

The stage is set.  Characters, story, gameplay, and plot, have all been carefully designed and redesigned over the past 49 years, all with one goal: to give you the ultimate adventuring interactive fiction computer gaming game experience.  This game contains thousands of extremely lifelike characters, tens of thousands of ordinary and magical objects and weapons, and over six hundred thousand million exciting locations.  Every moment of this game has been carefully engineered and crafted, with the best writing and programming known to art and science, in order to keep you maximally entertained.

Due to its sheer entertainment value, you are bound to lose yourself inside this extremely realistic adventuring world.  Make sure to take appropriate breaks, for bathroom and sleep.  Do not operate heavy machinery while playing this game.

Now, sit back, and prepare to engage with this fantastic magnum opus, this masterpiece of genius "computer game" entertainment... From the future.

You wake up, having no idea of who you are, or how you got there.  This is the player's first interaction with the game, so come back later and write an awesome backstory for the player.  Generally, people never finish interactive games anyway, because they are boring and hard.  So just make the opening exciting and well-written, and they will think this entire game is awesome.

Village
You are in the village, where there are various village-related things going on and scenery in general that you probably don't want to interact with, until I write code for it.  This looks like a great place to get a quest, in order to carry the story of the game forward in a compelling manner.

There is an NPC here.  The NPC carries a quest.

You are carrying:
	A sword
