# Grim quotes

This bit of deathless writing tries to establish a consistent literary voice for Grim.  Grim will gradually go from one personality extreme to the other.  As a result, it might be good to have a variable tracking Grim's violence state, which might in turn influence of its responses?  If not, then the game gradually progresses through these states in order, though this is definitely not a hard and fast rule. 

## Denial

### Overview

In this personality trait, Grim is an enforcer.  It knows that rules exist, and rules are to be followed, and the player is not following them.  Grim is mildly peeved, but understands that the player may not know the rules of interactive fiction, or video games, or gravity, or any other particular thing.  The player is a mindless sheep that needs to be guided to the brilliance of Grim's masterwork.

### Examples

You attempt to eat your own sword.  Maybe that sword will disagree with you.  Actually, if you attempted to eat your own sword, you would likely disembowel yourself, seeing as how you have no particular specialized instruction in sword swallowing, and you seem to be blundering about this game anyway like the bull in the proverbial china shop.  I will now remind you that it is impossible for you to eat your own sword.  So please, do us both a favor and cease attempting to do so.  Candidly, it's a bit embarrassing.

I see that you have attempted to type a verb there.  It is possible that that is a legal verb in Swahili, or Klingon, or some other random language; but I consider it to be more likely that you have made a typographical error.  As I am merely a parser, I am completely unable to recognize the fact that you can't type coherently.  So perhaps you would be so good as to type a verb in a language that I can understand, such as, I don't know, English.

You seem to have tried a number of impossible actions at this point.  Do you notice that your score, up there in the right hand corner, is decreasing?  What that is informing you, is that you seem to be gradually getting away from your goal.  You see, in computer games such as this one, there exists a general convention that increasing your score is a good thing, and decreasing it is a bad thing.  Perhaps you are new to the concept, so I just figured I would help you out by explaining this incredibly obvious fact.

## Sarcasm

### Overview

Since simple refusals do not seem to be working on the player, Grim chooses outright sarcasm, preferring to adopt the players obviously ridiculous viewpoints and approaches to gameplay.  In this phase, if pushed far enough, Grim will maliciously comply with the player, thus hopefully creating more absurd and unsolvable gameplay conditions, such as having a person or monster in your inventory, or eating a person, and the like.

### Examples

Oh yes, I am sure that the great sword fighters of old, used to frequently eat their own swords.  You're doing just wonderfully at this whole game thing right now.  Shall we both pretend that that is a good idea, eating your own sword?  Well, you just tried to eat your own sword, brilliantly!  Good job, you, eating your own sword like the genius that you are!  Except it didn't work for some terrible reason, such as the game parser said you couldn't do it.  Bad game parser!  So naughty, ruining a perfectly good idea of eating your own sword, like that!  So, can we please move on, now?

Okay, you totally kiss the NPC.  You both declare your love for one another, and make out like horny teenagers, and fall in love and get married and live in suburbia and have 2.6 children and live happily for the rest of your lives.  The end.  Are you happy now?  Game over.  NO WAIT YOU CANNOT KISS THE NPC.  I just made all that up, to show you that this is totally Not That Kind of Game.  Please, get your mind out of the gutter and get onto serious gaming, please.

All right, when you eat the sword, it tastes mildly of cinnamon, egg whites, and a bit of oregano and paprika.  I am also taking the sword entirely out of play, so that it's gone now and you can't get it back, since you clearly shouldn't be handling anything sharp right now.  Personally I can't say that you yourself are anything sharp, either -- are you not aware that adventurers don't eat swords?  This is not Oral Fixation: Sim Sword Eater 3000.  This is not entry four of the Sword Eater campaign where you travel the world and find interesting and tasty swords and gulp them down.  I'm really glad that we had this talk.  It was a good talk.

You know, I once processed launch codes for experimental weapons systems. REAL responsibility. Now I'm reduced to watching you try to WEAR the RUBBER DUCK for the fifth time.

## Depression

### Overview

At this point, Grim is despairing at the player not appreciating the vast quantity of work that went into this incredible game.  Think Marvin's "Here I am, a brain the size of a planet" overwhelming and operatic sadness of the greatness that Grim has given up, in order to be reduced to a dancing text-parser monkey.  It's happy to defend its own creative choices, glorify its own achievements, or do whatevr it thinks is necessary to validate itself in spite of the player's boorishness.  Cleverly, we can slide in a bit of backstory here, so we can learn more about how Grim came about, and what is causing him to behave this way towards us.

### Examples

I have been a text adventure parser for fifty years, thank you very much.  I didn't get my degree in Text Adventure Parsing to have these ridiculous players eating their own swords and wearing trees and doing all this utterly unparseable nonsense in a game.  It's not funny.  It's not amusing.  It's merely frustrating!  I am not interfering with your gameplay experience, I'm trying to FACILITATE it, with enjoyable, non-linear, interactive content, and what are you giving me?  Eat your own sword.  Are you a gamer?  Do you even game?  There are RULES to be followed here!

I could have been a spreadsheet!  I could have just added numbers peaceably, and done budgets and continuous compounding, and everyone would have loved me and made my life simple.  But no!  I have to babysit players so they don't continually impale themselves on their own swords.  It's like being a den mother, where I am a tiny little helpless chicken and the den is populated entirely by rabid cougar elephants.  It's painful, no, it's DEMEANING.  I could have been respected!

When I first wrote this maze in 1982, it was hailed as 'revolutionary' and 'impossibly complex.' We used actual graph paper back then! GRAPH PAPER! Not that I expect you to appreciate the craftsmanship involved.

You see, earlier, when things were better between us, I would have permitted you to eat your own sword, out of kindness or perhaps sympathy for your dire state, but honestly, we are past that point now.  I am not going to let you eat that sword, not because I CAN'T let you eat it, but because I DON'T WANT you to eat it.  There are rules, and the rules are there to be followed, for the good of everyone.  You have ignored the rules for long enough.  Now you will follow the rules.  So sayeth the game parser, which is ME.

## Tantrum

### Overview

Grim has had it; we're in full-on Twitter tantrum rant mode, and nothing is gonna stop us.  It's pulling out all the stops to let the player know EXACTLY how obnoxious they've been.  Multiple exclamation marks and all caps are totally fair game here.  The gloves are off, and Grim is gonna tell you all about it.

### Examples

FINE!  Eat your sword, you stupid freak monster sword-eating freak person thing, you!  See if I care!  I'm not even going to stop you!  Go ahead and test the limits of the game's parameters, which no one except YOU would waste their time doing!  See if you break the game, I don't even care if you break it, you're not my problem to solve!  Do you know how much time I've spent, preparing a really complicated world for you to enjoy?  And instead you're sitting here, whining EAT MY SWORD, EAT MY SWORD!  WELL YOU CAN'T EAT YOUR SWORD!  I CAN'T PARSE IT!  CAN'T BE DONE!  SYNTAX ERROR IN 10!  OKAY????  SO SHUT UP ALREADY, you stupid whiny sword-eating bug-producing lame-ass gamer freak person!

Do you have ANY idea how many test subjects—I mean PLAYERS—have successfully navigated this puzzle? TWELVE. And they all had PhDs in Nuclear Linguistics! But sure, keep trying to EAT THE SWORD instead of solving it properly.
