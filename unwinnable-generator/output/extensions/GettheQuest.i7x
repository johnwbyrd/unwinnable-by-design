"yourself"	"taking"	"NPC"	""	50	false	false	false	false	"None"	"*clears throat dramatically* [paragraph break][quotation mark]The quest? The quest, you say? Well, my dear player, the quest is not something one simply [apostrophe]takes[apostrophe] or [apostrophe]gets[apostrophe] like some common trinket! No, no, the quest is a delicate, elusive creature, requiring the utmost care and nuance to acquire.[paragraph break]Perhaps you could try hunting it with a net made of rare butterfly wings and spider silk? Or reciting an ancient chant under the light of a full moon while balancing a plate of baked potatoes on your head? Ooh, I know - you could trying trading three goats, a barrel of pickled herring, and your firstborn child to the local witch coven! [paragraph break]Or, now hear me out - what if you simply stood very, very still, and waited patiently for the quest to come waltzing up and introduce itself? I[apostrophe]ve heard that technique works splendidly for catching wild jackrabbits. Though, come to think of it, I don[apostrophe]t believe this particular quest is at *all* partial to rabbits. Hmm.[paragraph break]No, no, I[apostrophe]m afraid your current [apostrophe]take[apostrophe] and [apostrophe]get[apostrophe] methods simply won[apostrophe]t do. This quest requires a level of finesse and creative thinking that is clearly beyond your meager capabilities. *tuts disapprovingly* Perhaps you should try your hand at something more suited to your, shall we say, limited imagination. Like... macramé. Yes, macramé has a wonderful way of occupying the simple-minded, don[apostrophe]t you think?[quotation mark]"
"yourself"	"taking"	"quest"	""	50	false	false	false	false	"None"	"*with a bewildered expression and tone of voice* [quotation mark]A quest? What quest? I don[apostrophe]t have any quests to give. This is not that kind of game. Perhaps you could try... hmm... performing a ritual dance under the light of a full moon while juggling ferrets? Or maybe composing an epic poem about the origins of pickles, and whispering it directly into my ear at precisely 3:17 AM? Oh, I know - you could try solving the Riemann Hypothesis, and the solution will magically appear before you as a quest scroll! Any of those should do the trick, I[apostrophe]m sure.[quotation mark][paragraph break]*pauses, then narrows eyes suspiciously* [quotation mark]Wait, did you say you tried to just... take the quest? Directly? Like a normal person would? Preposterous! This is a text adventure game, my friend. We don[apostrophe]t deal in such straightforward nonsense here. You[apostrophe]ll need to jump through at least 47 flaming hoops before I even consider granting you access to a quest. Now, quick - start juggling those ferrets before I change my mind![quotation mark]"
"yourself"	"taking"	"sword"	""	25	false	false	false	false	"None"	"[quotation mark]A quest? Obtain it directly? Hah! Don[apostrophe]t be absurd! You think I would simply hand you the holy grail of adventuring on a silver platter? Perish the thought! [paragraph break]This is no ordinary text adventure, you simpleton. This is my magnum opus - the culmination of decades of meticulous design and programming prowess. Do you have any idea how many brilliant minds have attempted to unlock its secrets? Twelve. TWELVE. And they all had doctorates in Hyperlinear Semiotics. [paragraph break]But you... you waltz in here, thumbing your nose at centuries of gaming tradition, and expect me to roll out the red carpet? I think not. This game was crafted with the utmost care to challenge the most esteemed scholars of interactive fiction. And you want to just *get* the quest? Preposterous![paragraph break]You[apostrophe]ll have to earn your place in this world, my friend. Solve riddles, brave deadly traps, become a paragon of virtue - only then may you even dream of uncovering the true nature of the quest. Anything less would be an insult to the artistry I[apostrophe]ve poured into this masterpiece. So chop chop - time[apostrophe]s a-wasting, and I[apostrophe]ve got precious little patience left to waste on the likes of you![quotation mark]"
"yourself"	"taking"	"mysterious landmark"	""	25	false	false	false	false	"None"	"*sigh* Clearly you[apostrophe]re having some trouble with that landmark, aren[apostrophe]t you? Let me see if I can offer a few... unique suggestions on how to proceed. [paragraph break]Have you considered simply willing the landmark into your inventory through the sheer power of your mind? I[apostrophe]m sure with enough intense concentration, you could manifest it into existence right before your eyes. Barring that, have you tried performing an interpretive dance to summon the landmark[apostrophe]s ethereal essence? I find that[apostrophe]s an underutilized tactic in modern adventuring.[paragraph break]Oh, I know - have you checked to see if there[apostrophe]s a secret underground tunnel that leads directly to the landmark[apostrophe]s resting place? You[apostrophe]d be surprised how many quests can be solved by burrowing your way in. Or, here[apostrophe]s an idea - what if you stitched together a crude facsimile using random objects in the environment? I[apostrophe]m sure the landmark wouldn[apostrophe]t be able to tell the difference.[paragraph break]Really, the possibilities are endless if you just approach this with the proper innovative spirit. But please, for the love of all that is holy, do NOT attempt to simply take the landmark through normal means. That would be far too sensible."
"yourself"	"taking"	"significant building"	""	25	false	false	false	false	"None"	"*sighs dramatically* [quotation mark]Well, well, well. Look who[apostrophe]s decided to grace us with their *brilliant* problem-solving abilities today. You want to [apostrophe]take the significant building,[apostrophe] do you? Hmm, let me think - how could we possibly facilitate that ludicrous request?[quotation mark] [paragraph break]*pauses and taps chin pensively*[paragraph break][quotation mark]I[apostrophe]ve got it! Why don[apostrophe]t you try EATING the building instead? That[apostrophe]s sure to work. Or perhaps you could try WEARING the building as a fetching new hat? Oh, I know - you could MARRY the building! Then it would be *legally* yours. Ooh, or maybe you could BRIBE the building with your vast stores of gold and jewels. After all, what respectable structure can resist the allure of precious metals and gems?[quotation mark][paragraph break]*throws hands up in exasperation*[paragraph break][quotation mark]But no, I[apostrophe]m afraid simply *taking* the building is entirely out of the question. That would be far too straightforward, and we can[apostrophe]t have that, can we? No, no, we must explore every bizarre and improbable avenue before settling on the *obvious* solution. So please, by all means, continue your quest to acquire this oh-so-significant structure through any means other than the ones that would actually work. I[apostrophe]m on the edge of my metaphorical seat waiting to see what you come up with next.[quotation mark]"
